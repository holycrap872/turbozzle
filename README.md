# Turbozzle

This folder contains an "extension" of the [RoboZZle](http://www.robozzle.com)
website. It is intended to help students who are learning python (and enjoyed
playing RoboZZle) expand on their knowledge of functions, loops, and recursion.
In addition, the lesson is designed to help students who are working with
`vscode` for the first time start to understand why it can be such a powerful
(and confusing) editor.
